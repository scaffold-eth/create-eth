## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.18)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Install the latest version of Scaffold-ETH 2

```
npx create-eth@latest
```

This command will install all the necessary packages and dependencies, so it might take a while.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also initialize your project with one of our extensions to add specific features or starter-kits. Learn more in our [extensions documentation](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/extensions/).

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network that runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. Learn how to [customize your network configuration](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/quick-start/environment#1-initialize-a-local-blockchain).

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. You can find more information about how to customize your contract and deployment script in our [documentation](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/quick-start/environment#2-deploy-your-smart-contract).

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.
